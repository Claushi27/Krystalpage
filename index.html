                    <p>
                        Born in 2001 in Chile, I've always been a tender person. I lived a happy life, but honestly, I never thought I'd fall in love with someone on the other side of the world. Each step of my journey, every dream, unknowingly led me closer to you.

                    <h3>Krystal's (舒钰环) Chapter</h3>
                    <p>
                        Born in 2003, Krystal (舒钰环) navigated a complicated school life and a tough relationship with her father. She carried a lot of pressure, often feeling tired and just wanting to rest, not wake up early, and escape the high-pressure work life in China. Despite these burdens, she's incredibly strong, hard-working, and finished her degree at just 21. Her experiences shaped the amazing, resilient woman I love.

                    <p>What started on Tandem quickly led to a new chapter when you unexpectedly asked for my WhatsApp. I was so surprised, I didn't expect that offer would mean so much. At first, neither of us seemed very interested in a romantic way, but our conversations were really good, and they got more interesting every day.</p>

                    <h3>Feelings Grow Stronger & The "Just Friends" Confusion</h3>
                    <p>After talking a lot for days, I started feeling very close to you. I felt like you were a very special person I wanted to have near me more and more. Every day, I waited for your messages, sometimes even checking when you were online. There were times you didn't reply, or seemed to prefer talking to other people, which made me confused. Even though I tried to tell myself to stop having feelings for you, I couldn't help it. Then I told you how I felt, and you felt something too</p>
                    <p>But then, just two days later, you surprised me by saying "just friends" again. This was even more confusing because we often called for a long time; you didn't even want to hang up and would "sleep" with me on call. You shared your whole day with me, even when i was sleeping, despite our 12-hour time difference. It was hard, but I couldn't stop my feelings for you.</p>

                    <h3>Noodles & Daily Joys: Sharing Our Worlds and Your Love for Bake</h3>
                    <p>Our conversations beautifully blended into daily life. I remember cooking noodles to impress you, and also because I genuinely love them and want to try to make them but is so difficult hahaha I loved sharing what I cooked or ate, and you shared what you cooked or ate too. Getting to know different cultures through our food was amazing, and I started to feel much closer to you through these exchanges. Knowing your deep love for bake, every food photo we exchanged felt like a small, sweet piece of our cultures and lives coming together. It's truly special how you embrace new things, and how we share everything.</p>
                    <p>There are so many memories and pictures from this time, I couldn't put all of them Just some from the beginning, like when you went out with your friends, or photos with your cousin, or outings like milk tea, or what you eat. You also showed me your bakery skills, and I showed you me exercising or the view from my university, and even the page I was making.</p>

Watch series together on Discord, especially One Piece, and our routine video calls when u get really horny when i said layla layla hahahaha but i really loved seeing u every day. they're vital parts of our day, proving that love i need and u need every day even tho is difficult because i live with my parents. Your incredible willingness to say "yes" to everything, and to try new things even with the cultural differences like what we do en video call or what we want to try together in person. We even enjoy playing Wordle together is really funny sometimes and we are learning together i relly like we are triying to learn the languages tha the other speaks, thats what it started all and we are going to do it every day of ur lives baby.</p>

You spoke about feeling "lazy" sometimes, but what I saw was immense strength: working while completing your degree at just 21, and navigating difficult family relationships, particularly with your father. You are tired and want to rest, not wake up early, and escape the high-pressure Chinese work life. Your honesty, even when it’s tough, made me admire you even more. It showed me a side of you that is incredibly resilient and brave, and it solidified my desire to be there for you, always, because you are such a smart and hard-working person.</p>

I remember when I'd ask if you missed me, and you'd say you "didn't have time to miss anyone." But I knew you liked my different way of thinking, unlike some Chinese men who might be more traditional. u know i respect u like a woman and i will cook and clean for u my baby.</p>
                    <p>Then, on June 9th, something amazing happened. You accepted to open your heart again with me. From that day on, your heart opened more and more, each day bringing us closer.</p>

                    <h3>And Our Journey Continues... Forever</h3>
                    <p>This timeline captures just a fraction of our incredible journey. Every day with you, Krystal, is a new adventure, filled with discovery, laughter, and an ever-deepening love. I love telling you I want to kiss and hug you, and even though we are far apart right now, knowing I’ll be there soon fills my heart with happiness.</p>
                    <p>Our dream of traveling the world and building a life together, not in China but somewhere new, is a future I eagerly anticipate. Your immense effort to embrace new things and bridge our cultural differences fills my heart with immense gratitude. I know for certain we will be happy together. Our love, so strong and resilient, will conquer any obstacle. This is a promise for our future, a future I can't wait to build with you.</p>
