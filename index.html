                            Born in 2001 in Chile, I've always been a tender person. I lived a happy life, but honestly, I never thought I'd fall in love with someone on the other side of the world. Each step of my journey, every dream, unknowingly led me closer to you.

                        <p>
                            Born in 2003, Krystal (舒钰环) navigated a complicated school life and a tough relationship with her father. She carried a lot of pressure, often feeling tired and just wanting to rest, not wake up early, and escape the high-pressure work life in China. Despite these burdens, she's incredibly strong, hard-working, and finished her degree at just 21. Her experiences shaped the amazing, resilient woman I love.

I never imagined this simple message would change my life, and it's something I'd do a thousand times again. This is where it all began.</p>

                        <p>What started on Tandem quickly led to a new chapter when you unexpectedly asked for my WhatsApp. I was so surprised, I didn't expect that offer would mean so much. At first, neither of us seemed very interested in a romantic way, but our conversations were really good, and they got more interesting every day.</p>

                        <p>After talking a lot for days, I started feeling very close to you. I felt like you were a very special person I wanted to have near me more and more. Every day, I waited for your messages, sometimes even checking when you were online. There were times you didn't reply, or seemed to prefer talking to other people, which made me confused. Even though I tried to tell myself to stop having feelings for you, I couldn't help it. Then I told you how I felt, and you felt something too</p>
                        <p>But then, just two days later, you surprised me by saying "just friends" again. This was even more confusing because we often called for a long time; you didn't even want to hang up and would "sleep" with me on call. You shared your whole day with me, even when i was sleeping, despite our 12-hour time difference. It was hard, but I couldn't stop my feelings for you.</p>

                        <p>Our conversations beautifully blended into daily life. I remember cooking noodles to impress you, and also because I genuinely love them and want to try to make them but is so difficult hahaha I loved sharing what I cooked or ate, and you shared what you cooked or ate too. Getting to know different cultures through our food was amazing, and I started to feel much closer to you through these exchanges. Knowing your deep love for bake, every food photo we exchanged felt like a small, sweet piece of our cultures and lives coming together. It's truly special how you embrace new things, and how we share everything.</p>

                        <p>Our connection truly deepened when you opened up and shared the challenges of your demanding student life in China. You spoke about feeling "lazy" sometimes, but what I saw was immense strength: working while completing your degree at just 21, and navigating difficult family relationships, particularly with your father. You are tired and want to rest, not wake up early, and escape the high-pressure Chinese work life. Your honesty, even when it’s tough, made me admire you even more. It showed me a side of you that is incredibly resilient and brave, and it solidified my desire to be there for you, always, because you are such a smart and hard-working person.</p>

                        <p>You were closed off for a long time, Krystal, because of the distance, your past experiences and hate for chinese man. Many times, you pushed me away. I remember when I'd ask if you missed me, and you'd say you "didn't have time to miss anyone." But I knew you liked my different way of thinking, unlike some Chinese men who might be more traditional. u know i respect u like a woman and i will cook and clean for u my baby.</p>

                        <p>June 19th, 2025, became an incredibly special day. You told me you loved me, and it surprised me so much. You even said I was the first one, that not even your ex u loved him, and now you love me so much. I never would have thought I'd hear those words from you, especially after our early talks and when we were talking less or when you just wanted to be friends. It was a moment that meant the world to me and confirmed everything I felt.</p>

Your immense effort to embrace new things and bridge our cultural differences fills my heart with immense gratitude. I know for certain we will be happy together.
